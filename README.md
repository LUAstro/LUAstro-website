# Welcome to **[LUAstro.space](https://www.luastro.space)**'s directory!

In this README file, I'll explain the basics of the website's code as of the time of writing. I've split this document into several parts detailing, firstly, how to use GitHub (which the site is, of course, hosted in), 
how each page is formatted (with templates for new Blog pages), how the header, footer, image, and main container code works, and lastly some of the more technical parts like the Stylesheet's code, the scripts code, and (in my opinion 
the most complicated bit of code on the site) how the search bars work and how to add new pages or images to the results.

If you're a future LUAstro member in charge of maintaining this site, welcome, and don't worry too much. I've purposefully tried to make this document as thorough as possible and you probably won't need to know most of it. I didn't have too much coding experience before 
making this site, so don't worry if you haven't either, and much of this is all very straightforward to get to grips with. As the new person in charge of the site, feel free to make any changes you wish! Just bear in mind that 
another Exec member will take over from you at some point, so try and leave comments in your code, or even update this README in order for them to understand the changes.

<h1>GitHub, an Introduction</h1>

Hosting a website in GitHub has numerous benefits. Firstly, it's free, which is a massive plus! Secondly, it enables easy changes to be made via the green "Commit changes..." button you'll see when you open pages or by 
creating a new pull request (we'll get into them later), and lastly, it has a decent storage capability and good updating time. However it has its drawbacks too, which you should be made away of.

<h2>Downsides to GitHub hosting</h2>

As you can maybe guess already, GitHub isn't built solely around website hosting. Usually, it's used as a public repository for coding projects (whether that be the code for Siril, or for some niche Minecraft plugin, all 
sorts of code is put on here). As a result, some of the parts of GitHub can actually seem a little counter-intuitive for website development, making things more difficult for people who are inexperienced at web development. 
Another drawback is that free GitHub repositories can be "forked". What this means is that all of this code you see here, including this README file, is technically publically accessible by anyone, and can be "forked" (copied 
whilst sharing visibility settings) by absolutely anyone too. As a result, I'd recommend that you keep the name of this GitHub account confidential (which I didn't really make easy when I just called the account "LUAstro", 
sorry about that). The most major drawback though is that there is no easy UI for web development - you have to write the fundamental CSS, HTML & JavaScript code yourself (or use an AI chatbot to do it). This is a benefit too 
in that you'll hopefully get a neat bit of coding experience from all this, but does make adding in new things, even just a new container type, a bit of a pain. Sites like Wordpress, SquareSpace, Wix, etc. exist that can 
enable developers to just easily add things in without coding at all, even with basic templates available to begin with, so maybe one day the site will be moved to one of them instead - I'll leave that up to future Execs.

<h2>The basics</h2>

So, where to begin then?
