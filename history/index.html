      <p>Hello reader. I've tried my best to fill the gaps in the Society's history, and give a complete overview from its founding in 1970, to the Present Day. Unfortunately, some things have been lost or 
      forgotten, so there may be some gaps here and there - particularly in the region from 1980-2010. I want to give a particular thank you to Dr Allan Chapman, for his assistance and insight on the Society's 
      early history, including its initial founding by him in 1969. Without him not only would I not have much to work on, but there wouldn't be an early history to begin with! <br> John Ray -25/26 President</p>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>Since he first saw the Moon through a 'coin in the slot' telescope on Torquay Harbour around the age of 9, Dr Allan Chapman grew fascinated with Astronomy. He made his first simple telescope from an old pair of 
        spectacles and a Watchmaker's eyeglass, aged about 11 or 12, while still at Secondary Modern school, and went on to be an early member of his local <a href="https://salfordastro.org.uk/">Salford Astronomical Society</a> around the age of 19, during its founding
        in 1965 (today continuing as the Society's Honourary President). Naturally, when he came to Lancaster as a mature student in 1969, he set about creating a Society of his own - Lancaster University's own Astronomical Society.
      On founding the Society, he was told that the University Offices already had a telescope, specifically a Japanese-made 3-inch equatorial refractor with a tripod, and that he could have it. From this came an idea - to 
      create an Astronomy Dome to house it; enabling its use by fellow students and staff members.</p>
   </section>
    <section>
      <p>"The Observatory rapidly took shape in my mind, and from the six College Student Unions then in the University, I raised about ¬£100 to fund it. Permission was granted for a small observatory on the University Field Station 
        off the lane leading down to Galgate,  and I prepared a set of drawings (I was always a good draughtsman) for submission to the University Architect.  The plans were accepted, and I began work on the Observatory in early July 1970.  
        I was allowed to retain my room in Fylde College during construction, and returned to my native Swinton & Pendlebury on my small motorcycle every few days." <br> - Dr Allan Chapman, in a correspondence to Professor Isobel Hook from April 2024</p>
    </section>

    <section class="intro">
      <p>He submitted plans to the University Architect for a 6-by-10-foot wooden timber building to mount a six-foot dome with a movable slit, that could rotate on grooved wheels, which was approved. Bert Tyson, then in charge of the University Maintenance Dept., 
        down near St Leonards' Gate in the City, gave him floor space, and assisted him in using a large bandsaw to cut wooden arches, onto which 6mm-thick 'marine' plywood was nailed. These were used for the roof segments which supported the dome, alongside occasional workshop help from his Father and Grandfather.
        A rectangular building, made of the same strong marine plywood, was also constructed. This measured 6-by-12 feet and supported the finished dome and rotary trackway. <br><br>
        Ultimately, the entire observatory was designed and constructed by him in less than one month - an accomplishment made even more impressive by the fact that he studied neither Physics nor Engineering, but was a reader in History. For it being summer vacation when it was being constructed, no students were around.
